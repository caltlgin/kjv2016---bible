The Foundation of the King James Version
========================================
The translators of the King James Version 2016 believe that the King James Version of 1611-1900 is an accurate translation of the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, in every detail and is thus by default, the words of God in English. Unfortunately for the KJV, the fluidity and popularity of international English language is causing it to be constantly evolving, and many word meanings today vastly differ from the English of the reformation era. Many people have preferred more readable, modern bible substitutes, oftentimes at the expense of quality. This version should not be recognised as a translational attempt to improve on the work of the original 1611 translators, but rather classified as a reluctant update to make more understandable the archaic and obsolete words and grammar, so that today’s reader can understand and enjoy the word of God clearly and accurately in the English tongue, just as our forefathers once did. We believe the KJV is the most superior of all English versions based upon the Masoretic Text (MT) and Textus Receptus (TR), and vastly advanced in comparison to corrupted versions based upon Westcott & Hort/Nestle- Aland/UBS, or Majority type texts. We believe the New King James Version, Modern English Version, and other similar MT/TR bibles contain a mixture of good and bad readings. This version has been designed especially to address those concerns.

Updating words and grammar, not the text
========================================
In non Textus Receptus versions, the issue of having correct definitions is often overshadowed by the massive amount of omissions in the text because of corrupted underlying manuscripts. Since the KJV 2016 translation is not dealing with such corrosive issues of omission and addition, the focus has been purely upon updating definitions and grammar, and the KJV translators accurate choices have been used as the benchmark. The issue often overshadowed in the bible version debate is simply the way Greek words have been redefined in the modern era for modern versions. Unfortunately, the NKJV leans upon the definition choices of other Critical Text based modern versions as well as defaulting to Vines and Strong's definitions, which are almost always favourable to the Revised Version. In other words, one may have a correct text to translate from, but may use erroneous modern version/modern dictionary definitions which change or distort the meaning of the words being translated. Jay Green and his Modern King James Version was accused of having a good TR bible but with “Alexandrian readings”. The KJV 2016 Edition rejects such erroneous modern definitions and restores the distinctness of historical KJV readings. The NKJV has also tended to gravitate toward the KJV marginal notes, which are in truth, rejected readings, and also toward Geneva Bible definitions, which the KJV had already examined and cleared up. We have endeavoured to keep the words as close to the 1611-1900 as possible, but where needed we have provided corresponding modern words and grammar.

Do we need yet another new version?
===================================
There is a glut of “bibles” on the market, but how many can truly be labelled as akin to the King James? As Christians, we must be careful to make intelligent and informed decisions about which translation of the Bible we choose to read. On one extreme, we have people who would give us heretical new translations that attempt to change God’s Word to make it politically correct. Many new translations are not only poorly translated but are based upon poor manuscripts. But equally dangerous, is the other extreme… of believing that any English translation that was produced after the original King James Bible will be heretical. Many who love the King James Bible reject any attempt to modernize the Bible because of the glut of poor translations that have flooded the market in the past century. The natural updating process that should have occurred to the KJV has been stifled and thwarted by the introduction of corrupt and counterfeit bibles. We must remember that one of the main purposes of the Protestant Reformation was to stop the Bible being imprisoned in an ancient language that few could understand, and into the modern, spoken, conversational language of the present day.

The original manuscripts of the New Testament were not written with all the eloquence of Classical Greek but in Koine Greek. In Greek “Koine” means common. The Bible was originally written in the commonly spoken, conversational language of the day. William Tyndale, who produced the first printed Bible in English, fought and died for the right to print the Bible in the common, spoken, modern English tongue of his day. Tyndale boldly told one official who criticized his efforts, “If God spare my life, I will see to it that the boy who drives the ploughshare knows more of the scripture than you, Sir!” Will we now go backwards, and seek to imprison God’s Word once again in old translations? Clearly it is not God’s will that we overreact to some of the bad modern translations, by rejecting all new translations. The Word of God is unchanging from generation to generation, but our language is a dynamic and ever changing form of communication. We therefore have a responsibility before God as Christians to make sure that each generation has a modern translation that they can easily understand, yet that does not sacrifice accuracy in any way. With all this in mind the King James Version 2016 seeks to continue the work of updating the Bible into the language of today. This new Bible does not seek to replace the original King James Version, it was made to replace modern translations based on corrupt manuscripts. With the pre-eminence of English being spoken in so many nations, it would be a shame to miss the window of opportunity to offer them an accurate, readable, modern English version. We have just completed New Testament’s based upon the MT/TR/KJV in both Urdu and Khmer. Our sincere heart’s desire is to see the world flooded with good, reliable, accurate, readable versions. We are open to anyone who wants to help with our project and welcome your feedback. We are open to the scholarly input of others and may from time to time inspect and again work on words in this translation to bring them closer to the original meaning of the KJV, and also to a clearer understanding for the modern reader.

Many hours have gone into this version to achieve the greatest possible accuracy. If you feel in any way this version has compromised the original meaning of the text of the 1611-1900 KJV, please feel free to contact us, and we will seriously and prayerfully acknowledge any concerns.
